				"Hey, everyone! Welcome back to Offbeat Banter, I’m your host Jinji! Today’s episode is gonna be super fun because I’ve got a super calm guy sitting next to me!",
			chinese:
				"大家好，欢迎来到《Offbeat Banter》，我是你们的主持人 Jinji！今天的节目一定超级有趣，因为我旁边坐着一个——超冷静的家伙！",
		},
		{
			character: "Muztag",
			emoji: "neutral",
			english:
				"I have no interest in adding “fun” to your show. I’m just here as a guest.",
			chinese: "我没有兴趣为你增加节目的“趣味性”，我只是在这里做客。",
		},
		{
			character: "Jinji",
			emoji: "happy",
			english:
				"Oh, don’t be so cold! Today, we’re gonna talk about some fun language quirks, like those funny expressions. You know I love digging into these!",
			chinese:
				"哦，别这么冷酷嘛！今天我们要聊聊语言中的一些有趣现象，像是那些很有趣的表达方式。你知道的，我喜欢探讨这些！",
		},
		{
			character: "Muztag",
			emoji: "neutral",
			english:
				"If you define “fun” that way, I can understand. But from my perspective, the “fun” in these language quirks is, frankly, negligible.",
			chinese:
				"如果你觉得“fun”是“有趣”的定义，那我可以理解。但从我的角度来看，这些语言现象的“趣味性”实在是微乎其微。",
		},
		{
			character: "Jinji",
			emoji: "surprised",
			english:
				"Ha! See? You’re back to your cold mode again. Alright, I know you like to analyze things coolly, but today let’s take a less serious approach! Can you just relax a little?",
			chinese:
				"哈！你看！你又开始了你的冷静模式。好啦，我知道你喜欢冷静分析，但今天我们可以用点不那么严肃的方式来讨论！你能不能先放松一下？",
		},
		{
			character: "Muztag",
			emoji: "neutral",
			english:
				"I don’t need to relax, because I don’t think any of these language issues are worth getting worked up about.",
			chinese: "我并不需要放松，因为我不认为任何这些语言问题值得紧张。",
		},
		{
			character: "Jinji",
			emoji: "happy",
			english:
				"Haha, oh my gosh, you always analyze everything so precisely! But don’t you think “‘Scuse me” actually feels more casual? Sometimes we use it to make an apology feel lighthearted.",
			chinese:
				"哈哈，天哪，你总是把一切都分析得这么严谨！不过你不觉得“'Scuse me”反而给人一种很随意的感觉吗？有时候我们用这个来表示轻松的道歉。",
		},
		{
			character: "Muztag",
			emoji: "neutral",
			english:
				"“'Scuse me”? Short, concise, and efficient, but if you really want the other person to feel your genuine apology, perhaps “Excuse me” would be more appropriate.",
			chinese:
				"“'Scuse me”？简短、简洁，符合效率，但如果你真想让对方感到你真诚的歉意，或许“Excuse me”更为合适。",
		},
		{
			character: "Jinji",
			emoji: "happy",
			english:
				"Exactly! You could call it a “soft bypass”. See, language is like that sometimes – we express ourselves casually without hurting anyone’s feelings.",
			chinese:
				"没错！你可以理解为“软性避开”。你看，语言有时就是这样，在不伤害别人感情的情况下，我们轻松表达。",
		},
		{
			character: "Muztag",
			emoji: "neutral",
			english:
				"“Soft bypass” is a good term. I guess your understanding of many things has a “lively” style.",
			chinese:
				"“软性避开”是个不错的词语。我猜你对很多事情的理解都带有“跳脱”的风格。",
		},
		{
			character: "Jinji",
			emoji: "happy",
			english:
				"Yes, I just love thinking outside the box! Now, let’s talk about the expression “How’s it goin’?”. What do you think about it? Is it good or bad?",
			chinese:
				"是的，我就是喜欢跳脱思维！好了，接下来我们讨论一下“最近咋样”这种表达吧！你觉得它好还是不好？",
		},
		{
			character: "Muztag",
			emoji: "neutral",
			english:
				"“How’s it goin’”? Simple, essentially asking about the other person’s state, but without delving too deep, maintaining social distance while keeping basic politeness.",
			chinese:
				"“最近咋样”？这很简单，基本上是询问对方的状况，但也不必过于深入，保持社交距离的同时又能保持基本的礼貌。",
		},
		{
			character: "Jinji",
			emoji: "happy",
			english:
				"Ha! That’s the style I like! It’s casual, but it brings people closer together! Plus, it doesn’t come with too much pressure, perfect for any occasion!",
			chinese:
				"哈哈！这就是我喜欢的风格！它很随意，但又能拉近人们之间的距离！而且，它不需要太多压力，适合任何场合！",
		},
		{
			character: "Muztag",

				"You always manage to make simple things sound so enthusiastic, it’s quite impressive.",

			character: "Jinji",
			emoji: "happy",
			english:
				"Hehe, thanks for the compliment! But maybe you could relax a little too? After all, we’re just chatting, and language can be casual!",
			chinese:
				"嘿嘿，谢谢夸奖！不过你是不是稍微也能放松一点？我们毕竟只是聊聊天，语言也可以是轻松的！",
		},
		{
			character: "Muztag",
			emoji: "neutral",
			english:
				"I’ll consider it, but I don’t believe that chatting and language must always be casual.",
			chinese: "我会考虑一下，但我并不觉得聊天和语言必须是随意的。",
		},
		{
			character: "Jinji",
			emoji: "happy",

				"Oh well, it’s fine, we’re keeping it light today! Next time, we’ll dive deeper into these language phenomena!",
			chinese:
